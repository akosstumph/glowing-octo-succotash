# 1st learning project, SQL, Tableau - Decision making about investment in Brazil

## I have done this project during my first two learning weeks in the boot camp. 
### The main goal was to get familier with **SQL, Tableau** and based on the findings to have a decision whether our company should invest in Brazil or not.  
The task was really helpful to learn some functions of **SQL(joining tables, sorting, filtering, grouping, aggregates, aliases, wildcards, case when)**
Tableau: data visualisation, filtering, calculations
Present all the findings and have decision to invest in Brazil.
The database what I used for analyses can be found here:
