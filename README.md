# 1st learning project, SQL, Tableau - Decision making about investment in Brazil

## Project goal:
Eniac is an e-commerece store in Europe. The company is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market. Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. My task was to have a suggestion if Eniac should make a contract with Magist in the Brazlian market based on the figuers, provided by Magist. 

Two main concerns. 

Is the new platform a good fit for our high-end tech products?
Are orders delivered on time?

### Key learning points: **SQL, Tableau**
**SQL(joining tables, sorting, filtering, grouping, aggregates, aliases, wildcards, case when)**
Tableau: data visualisation, filtering, calculations
