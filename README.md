1st learning project, SQL, Tableau - Decision making about investment in Brazil
I have done this project during my first two learning weeks in the boot camp. 
The main goal was to get familier with SQL, Tableau and based on the findings to have a decision whether our company should invest in Brazil or not.
The task was really helpful to learn some functions of SQL(joining tables, sorting, filtering, grouping, aggregates, aliases, wildcards, case when)
Tableau: data visualisation, filtering, calculations
Present all the findings and have decision to invest in Brazil.
